## shorten

> Create and manage a personal URL shortener with GitHub Pages.

Shorten lets you create, view, and manage shortened URLs. Repositories are saved to your GitHub account and all pages are hosted with GitHub Pages. Redirection is done with HTML5's [`http-equiv` refresh attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#attr-http-equiv).

### Installation

  - Requires Go to be [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [configured](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing).

  - Install with Go:

    ```sh
    $ go get -v github.com/kshvmdn/shorten
    $ shorten --help
    ```

  - Or install directly via source:

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/kshvmdn/shorten.git $GOPATH/src/kshvmdn/shorten
    $ cd $_
    $ make install && make
    $ ./shorten --help
    ```

### Usage

  - View the help dialogue by passing the `--help` / `-h` flag. View the specific help dialogue for each command by running `shorten [command] --help`.

    ```
    $ shorten --help
    Create and manage shortened URLs with GitHub Pages.

    Usage:
      shorten [command]

    Available Commands:
      create      Create a new shortened URL.
      export      Print the current config. file.
      help        Help about any command
      import      Import a pre-existing config. file.
      list        Print a list of currently active URLs.
      remove      Remove a shortened URL and delete the associated repository.

    Use "shorten [command] --help" for more information about a command.
    ```

  - On first run, you'll be prompted for a GitHub access token. You can request that [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Shorten only requires the `repo`, `user`, and `delete_repo` permissions. Note that your access token will **only** be stored locally (in `~/.shorten.toml`).

This project is completely open source. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/kshvmdn/shorten/issues) with questions / suggestions / requests or [create a pull request](https://github.com/kshvmdn/shorten/pulls) to contribute!

#### TODO

- Better handling of error messages, right now I just `log.Fatal` everything.
- Add functionality to check if a URL already has a repository (this isn't hard to implement since we could just search through the current entries, but I think it's worth it to find a more efficient method).
- Verify that a repository with the specified name doesn't already exist. If it does and it's a _Shorten repository_, add a way to replace the URL.
